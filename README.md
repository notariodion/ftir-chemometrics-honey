# Honey Adulteration Detection using FTIR and Chemometrics

This repository contains R scripts and result files related to a research project focused on detecting honey adulteration using **Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)** combined with **chemometric analysis**.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify **pure and adulterated longan honey** samples based on their FTIR spectral fingerprints using chemometric models built in R. This repository is part of an ongoing research effort and serves as a platform for rapid communication and collaboration with other researchers interested in food authenticity, spectral analysis, and chemometrics.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- `script.R`:  
  The main R script used for building classification models (e.g., PLS-DA) to distinguish between authentic and adulterated longan honey samples.
  
- `result/`:  
  A folder containing model outputs and validation results generated from the current analysis.

> **Note:** The dataset used for modeling is **not yet included** in this repository. The model is still under development, and the dataset will be shared once a more robust and generalizable model has been established.

## Background

Honey adulteration is a significant issue in food quality and safety. In this study, we focus specifically on **longan honey**, which is often subject to adulteration with substances such as **corn syrup** and **cane sugar**. FTIR spectroscopy offers a rapid, non-destructive analytical method, while chemometric techniques enable the extraction of meaningful patterns from complex spectral data.

## Purpose of this Repository

- To share the R-based analytical workflow for reproducibility and peer input.
- To facilitate fast communication with fellow researchers.
- To open opportunities for collaboration on improving classification models and expanding the spectral dataset.
